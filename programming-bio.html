		<pre class="pre-serif">My experience with application development started around 2002, when I created my first computer game using The Games Factory, a visual game development tool. I started learning my first programming language, C++, around 2004.

I was involved in a major Polish game development community based around the website gamedev.pl (later moved to warsztat.gd), participating in game development competitions, even organizing one. I was also briefly involved in development of <a href="https://app.assembla.com/spaces/gdpl/wiki">Warlock's Gauntlet</a> -- a major project written in C++ created by members of the communtiy. I learned the basics of the exotic <a href="http://squirrel-lang.org/">Squirrel scripting language</a> as a part of this project.

I went on to learn many more programming languages (such as C, D, Vala, Pascal), writing computer games for competitions and various small projects. I also got interested in web development, learning some (X)HTML, CSS, PHP, basic JavaScript, SQL and creating websites and a content management system.

At Technical University of Łódź I studied Computer Science (aka Informatics) and created projects in Java, C#, Ada, x86 assembly, wrote scripts in Bash and Python, queries in SQL and other fun stuff. I did an internship at University of Edinburgh, which involved learning a lot about functional programming. I read and wrote some Haskell and OCaml. I wrote games in Links, an experimental functional web programming language developed by a team of some the best programming language researchers in the world led by Philip Wadler. I learned more JavaScript, which became my go-to programming language from then on.

While doing my master's, I started working at Samsung in Łódź as a JavaScript developer. I learned AngularJS there and a lot about web application development. After three months, the Łódź office was closed and I worked in Warsaw, while living and studying in Łódź. After a few long months of that, I went to work for Mobica in Łódź. There I intensely worked for the duration of my initial contract, after which I focused on completing my master's.

From the very beginning of my adventure with programming I was fascinated with programming language design and at some point I wanted to develop my own language. I created Brainfuck interpreters, various small domain-specific languages, and eventually, for my thesis, my own Lisp-based hybrid text and visual web programming language capable of implementing a full-featured Pac-Man clone. A big step on my language-designer path, which I will certainly follow into the future.

In the meantime I was involved in a start-up as one of the main developers in an ambitious web application, which placed its technological bets on cutting-edge trends, such as full stack JavaScript with Angular 2 and LoopBack. And like many start-ups, this one too died an early death of overambition and underfunding.

I completed my master's degree and, after taking a little break, in the winter of 2017 I moved on to work for TomTom Polska in Łódź, initially as a front-end developer. I was given a task of developing a web application from scratch, based on early mock ups, as a sole front-end developer in an all-backend team. After about nine months the baby was born and successfully launched into production and is still up and running, serving paying customers as of this writing. 

Next, an opportunnity presented itself to join a friend in forming a Scala-pioneering back-end team. We took over several Scala and Java projects from a similarly progressive team abroad and carried on with their maintenance and development. We also rewrote another Scala project and maintained and extended some Java projects. For me this involved basically learning Scala from scratch along with technologies like Akka and Play. We started as a two-person team and quickly grew.

A possibility came along for my friend and me of joining the aforementioned progressive team abroad. We decided to pursue that and eventually landed in Berlin, working for TomTom Germany. There we took on new Scala projects.

All throughout my time as a back-end developer I continued to work with JavaScript and later on TypeScript, creating internal visualisation tools.

<i>To be continued...</i>

Meanwhile I am always looking for interesting opportunities to continue developing my skills as well as learn something new.</pre>
