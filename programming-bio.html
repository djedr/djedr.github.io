		<pre class="pre-serif">My experience with application development started around 2002, when I created my first computer game using The Games Factory, a visual game development tool. I started learning my first programming language, C++, around 2004.

I was involved in a major Polish game development community based around the website gamedev.pl (later moved to warsztat.gd), participating in game development competitions, even organizing one. I was also briefly involved in development of <a href="https://app.assembla.com/spaces/gdpl/wiki">Warlock's Gauntlet</a> -- a major project written in C++ created by members of the communtiy. I learned the basics of the exotic <a href="http://squirrel-lang.org/">Squirrel scripting language</a> as a part of this project.

I went on to learn many more programming languages (such as C, D, Vala, Pascal), writing computer games for competitions and various small projects. I also got interested in web development, learning some (X)HTML, CSS, PHP, basic JavaScript, SQL and creating websites and a content management system.

At Technical University of Łódź I studied Computer Science (aka Informatics) and created projects in Java, C#, Ada, x86 assembly, wrote scripts in Bash and Python, queries in SQL and other fun stuff. I did an internship at University of Edinburgh, which involved learning a lot about functional programming. I read and wrote some Haskell and OCaml. I wrote games in Links, an experimental functional web programming language developed by a team of some the best programming language researchers in the world led by Philip Wadler. I learned more JavaScript, which became my go-to programming language from then on.

While doing my Master's, I started working at Samsung in Łódź as a JavaScript developer. I learned AngularJS there and a lot about web application development. After three months, the Łódź office was closed and I worked in Warsaw, while living and studying in Łódź. After a few long months of that, I went to work for Mobica in Łódź. There I intensely worked for the duration of my initial contract, after which I focused on completing my Master's.

From the very beginning of my adventure with programming I was fascinated with programming language design and at some point I wanted to develop my own language. I created Brainfuck interpreters, various small domain-specific languages, and eventually, for my thesis, my own Lisp-based hybrid text and visual web programming language capable of implementing a full-featured Pac-Man clone. A big step on my language-designer path, which I will certainly follow into the future.

In the meantime I was involved in a start-up as one of the main developers in an ambitious web application, which placed its technological bets on cutting-edge trends, such as full stack JavaScript with Angular 2 and LoopBack. And like many start-ups, this one too died an early death of overambition and underfunding.

I am always looking for interesting opportunities to continue developing my skills as well as learn something new.</pre>
