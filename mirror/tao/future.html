<p>TAO is a stable syntax with a well-defined <a href="grammar.html">minimal grammar</a>, ready to be adopted experimentally by software projects of various scales. This adoption and experimentation is important for verifying whether it stands on solid foundations as a <a href="tas.html">future UTAS</a>.</p>
<p>This is something that can be only achieved with the help of a community of enthusiasts and early-adopters.</p>
<p>TAO is a very generic tool which tries to consciously promote minimalist principles at the very low level of syntax with the hope that their benefits will propagate and add up to significant returns on higher levels, across different domains.</p>
<p>If TAO turns out to be a solid foundation, future work remains in building similarly solid higher-level building blocks and eventually systems on top of it. The following are some of the areas that would be good starting points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>telling others about TAO</p></li>
<li><p>implementing tools to work with TAO:</p>
<ul>
<li>parsers in different languages</li>
<li>editor support
<ul>
<li>novel syntax highlighting approaches may be needed</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>crystallizing and formally specifying <a href="shapes.html">the shapes of universal data types</a></p></li>
<li><p>development and experimients in domain-specific languages on top of TAO</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these may be explored on their own and be useful also outside of TAO itself. Also, all this can be done independently of any central management, so everybody interested is encouraged to start right away.</p>
<p>TAO-related projects can be linked to on this website. To suggest one to link, please <a href="https://github.com/tree-annotation">go to github</a> or contact <a href="https://djedr.github.io/tao.html">Dariusz JÄ™drzejczak</a>.</p>
