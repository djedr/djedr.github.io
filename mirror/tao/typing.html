<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is subject to <a href="future.html">future work</a>. Errors, ambiguities, and omissions are to be expected.</p>
<p>An overview of different useful approaches to typing is described here in the context of TAO which itself assumes no position but offers space for any approach.</p>
<h2 id="implicit">Implicit</h2>
<p>The implicit methods of typing are ones where the <strong>structure of the data itself</strong> is the primary mechanism for specifying and verifying data types.</p>
<p>The major typing disciplines known from programming languages that can be classified as implicit are: structural, dynamic, duck, and inferred.</p>
<p>Implicit typing is more flexible than explicit. It requires less effort but more care from humans in structuring data, as it makes machine verification more difficult.</p>
<p>In the context of TAO we might use the following definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>tao</code> which matches a structural definition of a type is of that type.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example if we define a <code>primitive</code> type as a <code>tao</code> with zero or more parts which are not <code>trees</code> then the following <code>tao</code>:</p>
<pre><code>this is a primitive</code></pre>
<p>is implicitly of type <code>primitive</code>, but the following:</p>
<pre><code>this is [not a primitive]</code></pre>
<p>is not.</p>
<h2 id="explicit">Explicit</h2>
<p>The explicit methods of typing are ones where <strong>type annotations</strong> attached to data are the primary mechanism for specifying and verifying data types.</p>
<p>The major typing disciplines known from programming languages that can be classified as explicit are: nominal, static, manifest.</p>
<p>Explicit typing is more rigid than implicit. It requires more effort but less care from humans in structuring data, as it facilitates machine verification.</p>
<p>In the context of TAO we might use the following definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>tao</code> may <a href="explicit.html">go together with a type annotation</a> which declares its type.</li>
</ul>
<p>A type annotation may serve as:</p>
<ul>
<li>documentation, statement of intention (for a human)</li>
<li>basis for verification (for a human or a machine)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example if we define a <code>primitive</code> type as a <code>tao</code> with zero or more parts which are not <code>trees</code> then the following <code>tao</code>:</p>
<pre><code>this is a primitive`: primitive</code></pre>
<p>is explicitly of type <code>primitive</code>, but the following:</p>
<pre><code>this is a primitive</code></pre>
<p>is not, even though it is implicitly <code>primitive</code>. On the other hand the following <code>tao</code>:</p>
<pre><code>this is [not a primitive]`: primitive</code></pre>
<p>is explicitly of type <code>primitive</code>, but not implicitly. This indicates, in principle, that there is an error either in the structure of the <code>tao</code> or in the type annotation or in the type definition itself. Automatic verification can be employed to signal errors like this.</p>
<h1 id="mixed">Mixed</h1>
<p>A mix of explicit and implicit typing is a pragmatic approach that tries to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of both.</p>
<p>In programming languages this may be known as gradual typing.</p>
