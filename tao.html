    <p>TAO is my simple but not easy project with a grand vision transplanted from dreams into reality on the off chance that it may succeed, even if in 50 years or more.</p>

    <p>It is meant to be a truly universal and modular syntax for ultra-large scale structural communication.</p>

    <p>I imagine future evolutions of formats like JSON, HTML, XML, S-expressions that all share TAO as their underlying syntax.</p>

    <p>Future aside, I am sharing it because I simply would love if something like it would be widely available and supported. Above all it is great fun for me to just develop a pet project like this.</p>

    <p>I hope you have as much fun using it as I have in developing it.</p>
