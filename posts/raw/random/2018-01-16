(Part I) What's so good about JavaScript?

[h3[]Background]
I started working with JavaScript [a[href[https://djedr.github.io/projects.html#Internship-at-University-of-Edinburgh]]in 2014]. This was my first real programming job and first real encounter with JavaScript beyond simple scripts.

The job was very much about functional programming. This was my first real practical encounter with that too. As a prerequisite, I was advised to read [a[href[http://learnyouahaskell.com/]]Learn You a Haskell]...
