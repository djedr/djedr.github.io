(Part nulla) What's so good about JavaScript?

[h3[]TL;DR]
Ease of sculpting thanks to a few tremendously powerful features in a working-developer-friendly package, deep attachment to ubiquitous platforms, keeping up with the newest-latest.

[h3[]More detailed summary]
Since more or less the beginning (maybe except *)
    Flexible first-class functions with closures
    Flexible, universal composite data types: arrays/lists and objects/maps
        With native syntactical support
        (* with optimized memory representations, at least in modern JS engines)
    Marketing:
        Familiar, C-like syntax
        Familiar, Java-like name ;)
        Shipped with every popular web browser
    Fairly good text-processing capabilities
        Built-in support for regular expressions
    Simple concurrency model
        Event loop, asynchrony
Since the internet was widely adopted
    Ubiquity, ability to develop and run anywhere without hassle
Since recently
    Relatively fast engines
    Native support for [b[]JS]ON (duh!)
    Relatively fast paced evolution, also in good directions
        More packaging of odd, but powerful features in familiar syntax
            Prototypes -> classes
        More recognition of benefits of immutability & functional approach
            Leaner (syntactically too) incarnation of first-class functions
            Some mutability control
        New native datastrucrues, filling some gaps
        Some more useful syntax (sugar)
            async/await
        ...
    Even greater ubiquity, thanks to popularity of Node.js
        Web browser no longer needed
        Can interact with the OS directly
        Can make server-side scripts
    Rich ecosystem & community of developers
        Some good libraries and frameworks
        Largest software registry, npm
    A predecessor/training wheels for TypeScript

To be continued.
