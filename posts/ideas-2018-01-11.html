In the context of programming, the word "string" almost always means a sequence of characters. Or, in other words, a piece of text. Like the below:
<pre>
    "These are some extremely good potatoes!"
</pre>

In most programming languages strings are delimited by the <code>"</code> character. If you pick a language at random, it may have many different types of strings with different delimiters, but you can most safely bet that putting text between <code>"</code> will work, more or less predictably.

Regular strings can't have line breaks inside them. So this would be incorrect:
<!--JSON--><pre>
    "Long time ago
    In a galaxy far away"
</pre>

Some languages do have a special type of string, which allows them though. This type is often called multiline string. But these usually have different delimiters than <code>"</code>. For example in Python this would be a correct multiline string:
<pre>
    """Long time ago
    In a galaxy far away"""
</pre>
As you can see, the delimiter here is <code>"""</code> instead of <code>"</code>

Interesting fact: you can try Python online <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">here</a>.

That's it for today!

See ya!
