<h2>100000000 (programming) ideas</h2>
<span class="date">2018-01-10</span>
This is the first of the 100000000 (programming) ideas I will present here this year.
That's my goal. So, without further ado.

JSON
Here is some JSON:
    {
        "item": "potatoes",
        "amount": "5 kg"
    }

Interesting fact: JS is probably the most popular programming lanugage in the world today.

Each post will aim to be short & sweet like this one. Each will feature a different programming concept and a different programming language. There will be a post most of the days in 2018. Stay tuned!

Cheerio!
