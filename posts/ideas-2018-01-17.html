		<div class="pre-wrap">Featuring: x86 assembly

The ability to make one decision when a certain condition is met and a different decision when it is not is a fundamental feature of <em>all</em> programming languages. Perhaps it is even fundamental to reality itself... <span style="color: darkgreen">mwahahaha</span>!

On the lowest level such conditions are very simple, like "is a number equal to zero?". The decisions similarly so, e.g. "should I execute the next instruction in line or should I jump to an instruction at some other location and continue executing there?".

Consider this fragment of more-or-less <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language">x86 assembly code</a> (lines which start with <code>;</code> are comments):
<pre>
    ; nonempty lines contain a single instruction and some data it operates on
    ; instructions are normally executed from top to bottom

    ; subtract one from some number:
    dec ecx

    ; jump to first instruction after the `some_other_location:`
    ; label below if after the subtraction the number is zero
    jz some_other_location

    ; if the number is not zero (so it was greater than one before subtraction), 
    ; continue with the next instruction in line:
    mov eax, ebx

    ; ... imagine some more instructions here


    ; this is the label
    some_other_location:

    ; ... imagine some other instructions
</pre>
This is a language almost as close to the machine as it gets, something an average CPU would understand.

Once we have a simple decision mechanism like this, we can build powerful abstractions on top of it and do all kinds of wonderful things!
